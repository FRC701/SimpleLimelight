#### Robovikes Limelight Standard Operating Procedure

Robovikes uses the Limelight Coprocessor and PhotonVision for robot computer vision.

### Background
The Limelight uses its configuration to identify which objects in its image is most likely to be the  target. It then sends this information to the RoboRIO where the main code is running.
- The Limelight is a raspberry pi compute module with a camera

For information about how to install the Limelight software and access the dashboard, visit the [official Limelight documentation](https://docs.Limelightvision.io/en/latest/)

### How the Limelight works



### Necessary Equipment

- Computer with Windows
- USB micro b  to USB port (v2 or 2+)
- USB type C to USB port (v3)
- Limelight v2 or v3 (https://limelightvision.io/collections/products)
- PhotonVision calibration sheet, calipers, with clipboard, and tape
-

### Determine Limelight version:

- Open the limelight by removing the 4x 1.5 mm start screws
- Remove lid
- Locate version info. The version should be v1, 2, 2+, or 3.

Robovikes has Limelight v2 and v3

### Install software

- Download and install Limelight usb drivers (https://limelightvision.io/pages/downloads)
- Download and install Balena Etcher (https://etcher.balena.io/)
- Download the latest PhotonVision firmware image here (e.g. `photonvision-v2024.1.2-linuxarm64-image_limelight2.xz`)
- Connect usb cable to Limelight and plug into computer. If it doesn't show up, make sure you have installed the Limelight USB drivers correctly
- Open BalenaEtcher
- Flash PhotonVision firmware
- Install firmware on Limelight 

- Install photonVision library

## V2, V2+

- Wire it up following these instructions https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/docs/installation/wiring.html
Network according to the diagram below: (https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/docs/installation/networking.html)
- Add passive 12 volt passive PoE ethernet to the coprocessor side or power it directly using +12V to the PDV/PDB or or a power bank on the micro USB (if allowed by this yearâ€™s rules).
- Connect the Limelight to a network (through radio, router or switch) that is shared by the laptop.
- Power on limelight
- Connect to RoboRio
- In browser connect to photon vision at the address `photonvision.local:5800`

- Set Team Number to `701`
- Import Settings
    - Hardware Config `hardwareConfig.json`
    - AprilTag Layout `AprilTagLayout`
- Set Static IP to `10.7.1.11` or `10.7.1.12` for second camera
- On Dashboard
    - Under Cameras, turn off Driver Mode
    - Click APRILTAG
    - Select AprilTag 36h11 (6.5in)
    - Rename Camera to photonvision
    - Rename Pipeline to AprilTag2024
    - Select Type AprilTag

 

## Calibration

- Print the PhotonVision chessboard 8x8x1 calibration sheet (`calibrationTarget-Chessboard.pdf`)
- Measure the square with calipers - should be close to 1". Write actual value (e.g. 0.97") in.
- Tape the sheet to a clipboard or piece of wood with a large border.
- Follow calibration instructions.
- Go to Cameras tab
- Start calibration.                              
- Move board around until colored lines appear and collect an image. Repeat at least 12 times.
- save calibration.
- repeat calibration for other resolutions. The higher the resolution, the lower frame rate.

## Port Forwarding

- In the `Robot.java` code, add the following line to the robotInit() function.

`Add PortForwarder.add(5800, "photonvision.local", 5800);``

## Camera Streams (For dashboard?):
Cameras will stream on ports `1181` and `1182` for the first camera and `1183` and `1184` for the second camera.

- Once connected and ready to connect to the RoboRIO, set a static IP to `10.7.1.11` for the first Limelight and `10.7.1.12` for the second Limelight.
